          <h4>ABOUT ME</h4>
              <p><strong>Hey Everyone!</strong> Welcome to my page.</p>
              <p>A year ago, I started asking myself questions like "Am I happy in the job i'm doing?" "Can I see myself in a life of sales forever?" (you know, those deep questions that we all have in our 30s) and the answer to both was <strong>NO</strong>.</p>

              <p>I've been in the tech world for many years now and i'm fascinated about how our lives have changed as technology and internet connectivity have become some much more available to us all, and I am excited to be riding the technology wave to see where it will take us in the next 5 to 10 years.  Will we all become lazy and not have to leave our seats to do anything as all of the smart Internet of Things devices are going to make our lives effortless by the day, and will we have flying cars like in Back to the future 2?? </p>

              <p>At tech conferences, I started hearing more and more discussion around the need to get more Women and people of minorities into tech.  To build more teams of inclusive collaborators working together to make cutting edge tech which will enhance and change the way we socialise, work more efficiently and smarter, run our homes etc.  And including coding into syllabus for young people to help to bring through the next generation into tech who will shape our lives even more so.</p>

              <p>I began to research what<strong> coding</strong> was, using youtube and online research to understand what this coding business was all about, and what it means to be a developer.  I was suprised at how diverse the world of coding is, in terms of the different coding languages, and the various roles there were from back end database/server side to front web development.</p>

              <p>Mid 2016 I went to a Marie Claire:At Work event to "put myself out there" and expand my network of successful women in the tech/digital eco system.  There were lots of workshops which I found most interesting.  One of them was an intro to coding which was facilited by Amali Awalis one of the founders of CodeFirst:Girls, a non-profit organisation who's goal is to run tech courses to young and professional women to bring more females into the tech world.  Amali gave a high level talk about the internet and development, along with information on up and coming coding courses CFG were running in 2016, and in that moment I knew that I wanted to explore this even more by actually learning a new skill.</p>

              <p>In June 2016, I began an 8 week Introduction to Web Development bootcamp which was one session a week in the evening for 8 weeks, and I can honestly say I didnt realise that I would have enjoyed it as much as I did.  Learning a new skill fed my appetite to learn, being around like minded women who were either learning a new skill to enhance their careers, or were considering a career change, and being welcomed into a new community made it a completely experience.</p>

              <p>I'm currently studying Full Stack Web Development full-time, and I wanted to create a place where I could demonstrate what I am learning, share my experiences and coding journey, plus be a place of resource to you.</p>

              <p>Feel free to get in touch, i'd love to hear from you! </p>
